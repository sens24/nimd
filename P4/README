Project IV test programs
========================

This archive contains two programs you may use to test your
implementation of nimd.

testc
-----

    Usage: testc <host> <port> <name>

testc is a basic client for the Nim game service. Users specify
the host and port of the server they wish to connect to and their
name. testc will then set up the connection, wait to be matched
into a game, and prompt the player to choose a pile and an amount
of stones to remove when it is their turn.

testc will prevent the user from moving out of turn, or from making
illegal moves.

rawc
----

    Usage: rawc <host> <port>

rawc opens a connection to the specified host and service and waits
for input from standard input or from the connection.

Data received from standard input will be transmitted to the remote
host, except for any trailing newline character.

Data received from the remote host will be printed to standard
output, with special attention for control and high-ASCII characters,
which might otherwise be missed.

Note that rawc has no knowledge of understanding of NGP, so you
will need to formulate correct messages yourself. Obviously, this
is only useful for debugging, when you want to control exactly what
bytes are sent to the server or see exactly what bytes you have
received.

The source code for rawc is included.
